# DS6013 Capstone is a course for you to apply everything you've learned in the data science program to doing challenging, messy, real-world work on a data science project. 
These capstone projects will challenge you in a number of important ways. You will need to work closely with your classmates, carefully managing the dynamics in your group to help the work move forward.
You will need to interact in a professional way with individuals outside our program. 
You will need to apply everything you know about acquiring and cleaning data, and about analyzing data. 
You will need to teach yourself new methods to accomplish the tasks that lay ahead of you and to overcome the problems that will get in your way. 
Most importantly, you will need to think creatively and practically about your research project.
